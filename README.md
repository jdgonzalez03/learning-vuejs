# VueJS Learning Journey

This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey as I learn VueJS. My goal is to share the projects and concepts I acquire along the way, relying on the official VueJS documentation and educational content from YouTube.

## Contents

- **`my-first-app`**: This folder has my first VueJS project. I focused on learning the basic fundamentals, components, and how to reuse code, following the official VueJS guide.

- **`todo.list`**: This folder has my TO-DO list in VueJS. It is a simple project where I practiced everything I learned about VueJS. I also used some filters in this project.

- **`vue-router`**: This project is a basic example of using the Vue Router library.

- **`fcc-calculator and calculator`**: These are both calculators from my freeCodeCamp certification. I made two versions, but only one passed all the tests.

- **`spend-smart`**: Spend Smart is a wallet to save and manage my cash and money. It is a simple project.

## Next Steps

As I continue learning, I plan to add more projects and explore advanced topics. This repository will grow alongside my knowledge, reflecting my progress and the new skills I acquire in VueJS.

Thank you for joining me on this learning journey!
