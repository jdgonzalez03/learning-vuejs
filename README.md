# VueJS Learning Journey

This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey as I learn VueJS. My goal is to share the projects and concepts I acquire along the way, relying on the official VueJS documentation and educational content from YouTube.

## Contents

- **`my-first-app`**: This folder contains my first VueJS project, where I have focused on learning the essential fundamentals, component in-depth concepts, and code reusability, following the official VueJS guide.

## Next Steps

As I continue learning, I plan to add more projects and explore advanced topics. This repository will grow alongside my knowledge, reflecting my progress and the new skills I acquire in VueJS.

Thank you for joining me on this learning journey!
